# Engineer Tweaks

#### engiex.lua is the experimental version of the mod and has the most recent changes.

#### krazedkirbengi.lua is the current version of the mod found on the Steam Workshop.

## Changes:
The Ability Bar now regenerates passively over time.

The Engineer now keeps Pressure stacks after the Ability Bar is full.

The Engineer can now crank and gain Pressure stacks while the Ability Bar is full.

The Crank Gun is no longer interrupted by enemy attacks.

Engineer base HP increased to 125.

The Engineer can now wield a Crossbow.

Superior Gaskets now only loses a single Pressure stack upon a kill with the Crank Gun rather than all stacks upon firing.

Full Head of Steam now loses a single Pressure stack upon a kill with the Crank Gun rather than all stacks upon firing (Full Head of Steam still loses stacks when Pressure stack duration ends).

Bombardier now increases bomb explosion radius and fire duration by 25%.

Gromril-Plated Shot super-armor damage increased to 40% (was 20% default).

Linked Compression Chamber now gives the Crank Gun 3 effective dodges (was 1 previously).

Linked Compression Chamber now has increased movement speed when firing or spinning the barrel of the Crank Gun (was 20% default, now 75%).

## Experimental version changes:

The Engineer can now crank and gain Pressure stacks while the Ability Bar is full.

The Crank Gun is no longer interrupted by enemy attacks.

Full Head of Steam now loses a single Pressure stack upon a kill with the Crank Gun rather than all stacks upon firing (Full Head of Steam still loses stacks when Pressure stack duration ends).

Bombardier now increases bomb explosion radius and fire duration by 25%.

Bombardier now allows the Engineer to start a level and respawn with one tier 2 Frag and Fire bomb.

Gromril-Plated Shot super-armor damage increased to 40% (was 20% default).

Linked Compression Chamber now gives the Crank Gun 3 effective dodges (was 1 previously).

Linked Compression Chamber now has increased movement speed when firing or spinning the barrel of the Crank Gun (was 20% default, now 75%).

## Known Issues

In Weaves it is possible for the Engineer to hold a total of 5 bombs in the final event after entering the portal with 3 bombs (experimental version only).

If the Engineer has Linked Compression Chamber the Crank Gun must be spun or fired for the number of effective dodges and movement speed to be updated. This can result in rare cases where the Engineer has one effective dodge instead of the intended three if they attempt to dodge with the Crank Gun without having used it (both versions).
