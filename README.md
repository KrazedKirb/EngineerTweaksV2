# Engineer Tweaks

Quality of Life and buffs for the Outcast Engineer. Wouldn't have been possible without the incredible help from raindish (:

#### krazedkirbengi.lua is the current version of the mod found on the Steam Workshop.

## Changes:
- The Engineer now has 125 HP (from 100).

- The Engineer can now use the Crossbow.

- The Engineer now keeps Pressure stacks after the Ability Bar is full.

- The Engineer can now generate Ability Bar via hitting enemies (not with the Crank Gun) and taking damage.

- The Crank Gun is no longer interrupted by enemy attacks.

- Full Head of Steam now loses a single Pressure stack upon a kill with the Crank Gun rather than all stacks upon firing (Full Head of Steam still loses stacks when Pressure stack duration ends).

- Superior Gaskets now only loses a single Pressure stack upon a kill with the Crank Gun rather than all stacks upon firing.

- The Engineer can now crank and gain Pressure stacks while the Ability Bar is full.

- Linked Compression Chamber now gives the Crank Gun 3 effective dodges (was 1 previously).

- Linked Compression Chamber now has increased movement speed when firing or spinning the barrel of the Crank Gun (was 20% default, now 60%).

- Linked Compression Chamber effective range increased (was 25 now 35) but has stronger damage falloff (power distribution was 0.125 now 0.03125).

- Innovative Ammo Hoppers effective range increased (was 25 now 35).

- Gromril-Plated Shot super-armor damage increased to 40% (was 20% default).

- Gromril-Plated Shot now has increased range (was 25 now 100) and tighter spread when stationary (adopted Repeater Handgun spread).

- Bombardier now grants one Tier 2 Frag and one Tier 2 Fire bomb at the start of the level.

- Bombardier now increases bomb explosion radius and fire duration by 25%.

- Piston Power now removes Overcharge slowdown (plus more later probably).

## Known Issues:

- In Weaves it is possible for the Engineer to hold a total of 5 bombs in the final event after entering the portal with 3 bombs.

- The Crank Gun barrel must be spun or fired for a given level 30 talentâ€™s stat adjustments to be updated. This can result in rare cases where the Crank Gun does not have the intended number of effective dodges if the Engineer has not yet tried to fire the Crank Gun.

- Clients using Bombardier are not granted the free bombs at the beginning of the level.

- Getting kills with the Crank Gun equipped will reduce Pressure stacks on applicable talents, even if the kill was not from the Crank Gun (for example, having the Crank Gun out while a Fire Bomb is burning will reduce Pressure stacks for each kill you get).
